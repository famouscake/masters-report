# This is an epic todo list










# Practical
- Run on random datasets.
- Run DP and 2xBFS performance again.
- Run on the large data sets.

- Find a way to do linear regression to make sure the algorithms are linear.
- Find a way to find the distribution of w's in random data sets. How do you infer things about larger ones?
