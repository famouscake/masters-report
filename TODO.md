    IMPORTANT
        - !!! THINK OF A NAME!
        - !!! Run Algorithms Correctness
        - !!! Final Refactor. W-Structures, Homology, EP vs DP        
        - !!! Say where you've done original research
        - !!! Fix References in text.
        - !!! Fix Table and Figures.

        - !!! Check Spelling and Grammar.


    MEDIUM
        - CH4. Find references for 2xBFS and DP algorithms.

        - CH7. Find Reference for GTOPO
        - Picture of Reeb Graph
        - Add index of tables
        - Add ref for first ct paper
        - Put spacing before definitions.
        - Space complexity of DP.
        - Add figure in improving 2xBSF accuracy


    SMALL
        - Add triangles to simplicial mesh.
        - Add more references.
        - Add Murmuration
        - Add Ethical Issues Addressed
        - Add column meanings in charts runing times.
        - Say you've added ct filtration in appendix.
        - Justify Things ???
        - CH4. Check if you notation about time complexity see if it's called that.
        - Restart numbering in DP algorithm pseudocode.
        - Make definitions not em.


    <!-- - CH2. Definitions about Reeb Graph should be taken directly from somewhere. Do not experiment. -->
    <!-- - CH2 Image about Reeb Graphs. You would have to draw a surface and a graph. (Octave + Dot). -->
    <!-- - CH3. Contour Tree Join/Split Tree Definition. Add superarcs and supernodes -->

    <!-- - CH7. Make table for NxBFS Testing -->
    <!-- - REF. Improve references. -->

    <!-- - Do New basis homoogy example with edges, not vertices -->
    <!-- - Add morse theory cirtical points at vertices to join, split trees. -->
    <!-- - Add this  The most recent extensions of this work introduce high quality topological simplification [4] where the contour tree is pruned incrementally to reduce its complexity and highlight the fundamental structures present in the data. The scheme involves exact and approx (FROM ORLY) -->
    <!-- - You have to add something in Join/Split Tree but I can't remember what. -->







# This is an epic todo list










# Practical
- Run on random datasets.
- Run DP and 2xBFS performance again.
- Run on the large data sets.

- Find a way to do linear regression to make sure the algorithms are linear.
- Find a way to find the distribution of w's in random data sets. How do you infer things about larger ones?
