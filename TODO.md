# This is an epic todo list

- Finish Algorithms Overview.
- Finish Contour Tree Simplification.

- Restart numbering in DP algorithm pseudocode.
- Do New basis homoogy example with edges, not vertices

- Add morse theory cirtical points at vertices to join, split trees.


- Add this  The most recent
extensions of this work introduce high quality topological simplification [4] where the contour tree is pruned incrementally to reduce
its complexity and highlight the fundamental structures present in
the data. The scheme involves exact and approx (FROM ORLY)

- Write the reflective thingy


# Practical
- Run on random datasets.
- Run DP and 2xBFS performance again.
- Run on the large data sets.

- Find a way to do linear regression to make sure the algorithms are linear.
- Find a way to find the distribution of w's in random data sets. How do you infer things about larger ones?

# Writing

- Write the Introduction
- Write the Logarithmic Collapse for Parallel

# Refactoring

- All of it!

# Figures, pictures and diagrams

- All of them
