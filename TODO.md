    - !!! Final Refactor.
    - !!! Check Spelling and Grammar.
    - !!! Fix Reference.
    - !!! Fix Table and Figures.
    - !!! Run Algorithms Correctness


    - CH4. Find references for 2xBFS and DP algorithms.
    - CH4. Find references for Hamiltonia path reduction 4.@.
    - CH7. Find Reference for GTOPO



    - CH7. Make table for NxBFS Testing

    - Add Murmuration
    - Say where you've done original research
    - Add index of tables

    - Refactor Conclusion.
    - Add Ethical Issues Addressed
    - Justify Things ???
    - Add column meanings in charts runing times.



    - CH2. Definitions about Reeb Graph should be taken directly from somewhere. Do not experiment.
    - CH2 Image about Reeb Graphs. You would have to draw a surface and a graph. (Octave + Dot).
    - CH3. Contour Tree Join/Split Tree Definition. Add superarcs and supernodes
    - CH4. Check if you notation about time complexity see if it's called that.
    - CH7. Make table for NxBFS Testing
    - REF. Improve references.
    - Restart numbering in DP algorithm pseudocode.
    - Do New basis homoogy example with edges, not vertices
    - Add morse theory cirtical points at vertices to join, split trees.
    - Add this  The most recent extensions of this work introduce high quality topological simplification [4] where the contour tree is pruned incrementally to reduce its complexity and highlight the fundamental structures present in the data. The scheme involves exact and approx (FROM ORLY)
    - You have to add something in Join/Split Tree but I can't remember what.















# This is an epic todo list










# Practical
- Run on random datasets.
- Run DP and 2xBFS performance again.
- Run on the large data sets.

- Find a way to do linear regression to make sure the algorithms are linear.
- Find a way to find the distribution of w's in random data sets. How do you infer things about larger ones?

# Writing

- Write the Introduction

- All of it!

# Figures, pictures and diagrams

- All of them
